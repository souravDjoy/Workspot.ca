# Workspot.ca
This is a start-up idea I worked on as a team for the Climate Action Hackathon in Halifax, Canada. This web platform allows people to rent out their spare spaces to other people who want to work together as group. Its similar idea as AirBnb, however much different in the sense it is for people who want to work together and need a private space for that purpose.
